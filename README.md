# BaryonEffectsEmulator
It is known that N-body simulation cannot trace the effects of baryons at medium and small cosmological scales. 
With this emulator we propose a fast and accurate remedy to this problem. 
For an accurate description of the BaryonEffectsEmulator refer to the research project MSc Thesis in the documentation folder.
